## About The App :wave:
This is a simple form for logging in or creating an account<br/>
It uses a client side validation written from scratch

The app is not connected to any database so it only demonstrates the client side functionality<br/>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## :eyes: available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

runs the app in the development mode.<br />
open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
it correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
